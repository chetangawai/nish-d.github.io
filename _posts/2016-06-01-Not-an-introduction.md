Had this been 2010 and had I been still in school, when the craze for blogging was relatively new, I would have probably begun by introducing myself, saying hello, and trying every bit to make you believe I was the girl next door who blogs and has a varied opinion on everything under the sun and up your ass. That would've probably been my first post. And then a few mundane and unrelated posts with a dying frequency and then finally I would forget the password to the system, and the fact that I ever blogged.

A few years later, someone would probably dig up the blog and we'd all have a good laugh over it, with my face so red, you'd think I was going to burst.

Fair enough, I'm still the same old person, but just not as narcissistic. If you're reading this, you probably came here, cause I asked you to, thrust the link on your face a couple of times and maybe even threatened (read begged) you. Therefore, no introductions required. Of course, if you happen to be here by sheer coincidence, woohoo! I'm really glad that happened. 

I guess this is the part, where I state why, and what this blog is about. But trust me, if I knew the answers to those questions, you wouldn't have been reading this. There would've been a quite sanely edited write up on things, how they work and why they do. Probably an insight to the workshop that is in my head, with it being so mundanely and morbidly idle, I had to rent it to the devil himself. 

Enough said. All I can hope is this doesn't turn up in "Top 10 embarrassing things Nishita did" on buzzFeed/scoopWhoop, when I'm all famous and rich. \*smug smile\*

*P.S. If I promised you a candy, money or a ride on my flying scooter for reading this, and you believed me, you've been cheated. Yes, the scooter exists. Peace out.*
