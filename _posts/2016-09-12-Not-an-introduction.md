excerpt: "Had this been 2010 and had I still been in school, when the craze for blogging was relatively new, where you looked upon every blogger with an awe reserved only for the rare category of nerdy combined with hep, I would have probably begun by introducing myself (read ASL), saying hello, trying to potray myself as the girl next door who blogs and has a varied opinion on everything under the sun and up your ass. From  rainbows to unicorns, friday evenings to monday mornings, dodgeball to VCop2 and Hardy Boys to Teen Titans."

Had this been 2010 and had I still been in school, when the craze for blogging was relatively new, where you looked upon every blogger with an awe reserved only for the rare category of nerdy combined with hep, I would have probably begun by introducing myself (read ASL), saying hello, trying to potray myself as the girl next door who blogs and has a varied opinion on everything under the sun and up your ass. From  rainbows to unicorns, friday evenings to monday mornings, dodgeball to VCop2 and Hardy Boys to Teen Titans.
 
And then a few mundane posts with a dying frequency, interspersed with --its been so long since my last post-- and finally end with forgetting the password to the system, and the fact that I ever blogged.

A few years later, someone would probably dig up the blog and we'd all have a good laugh over it, with my face so red, you'd think I was going to burst.

Fair enough, I'm still the same old person, but just not as narcissistic. If you're reading this, you probably came here, cause I asked you to, thrust the link on your face a couple of times and maybe even threatened (read begged) you. Therefore, no introductions required. You already know me. Of course, if you happen to be here by sheer coincidence, or for reasons other than the ones mentioned above, I'm really curious about what you were browsing and how that made you land up here.

I guess this is the part, where I state why, and what this blog is about. But trust me, if I knew the answers to those questions, you wouldn't have been reading this. There would've been a quite sanely edited write up on things, how they work and why they do. Probably an insight to the workshop that is in my head, with it being so mundanely and morbidly idle, I had to rent it to the devil himself. 

Enough said. All I can hope is this doesn't turn up in "Top 10 embarrassing things Nishita did" on buzzFeed/scoopWhoop, when I'm all famous and rich. \*smug smile\*

*P.S. If I promised you candy, money or a ride on my flying scooter for reading this, and you believed me, you've been cheated. Yes, the scooter exists. Peace.*
